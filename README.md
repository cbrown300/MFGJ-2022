# MFGJ-2022
This was for a GameJam over the summer of 2022. I spent a lot of time working on the movement and making other unessary features and did not focus on making levels or enemies. As a result I did not end up publishing it to the game jam. I spend a little more time polishing the movement afterward. If I was to continue to make the game I would work towards getting better assets for the vision I had in mind for the game. I am happy with what I did as it helped me to learn how Godot works. I think my biggest limitation was trying to use C# with godot as it was a language that I had experience with and did not want to learn gdscript. In the future it may be a good idea to just take the time and learn gdscript as there are better resources for it than that of C#.

The theme for the GameJam was Heal. I had the idea for a game where you were forced into being a vampire and as a result you were trying to be cured and get back your humanity. The basic game would have been 4-6 levels with each level having about 3 sub levels, with the final sub level having a boss fight. Each of the levels would focus on a specific power and would be easier if you still had your powers from the previous level. But since you lose them to become more human the levels become harder.

I may continue to work on this in the future as I liked the idea, but after a few months of inactivity I started on other projects.
